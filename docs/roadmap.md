# 🛠️ Roadmap: Prepare PACT for Early Adopter Validation

This checklist prioritizes improvements that will help new users understand, install, run, and trust the PACT protocol. We’ll work through 3 priority levels — from “must-run demo” to “real-world use cases.”

---

## ✅ Priority 1: Must-Have for First Impressions
- [ ] Add `Installation & Setup` instructions to README
- [ ] Include CLI/agent demo example in `README.md`
- [ ] Link to `CONTRIBUTING.md`, add license badge
- [ ] Add a protocol/agent communication flow diagram to `/docs` and embed in README

---

## ⚙️ Priority 2: Validate Behavior & Reliability
- [ ] Expand test coverage (especially fallback and intent negotiation paths)
- [ ] Add CLI or Postman demo guide in `/examples/`
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow to run lint & tests on PRs
- [ ] Add badge for build status in `README.md`

---

## 🌱 Priority 3: Community + Real-World Use
- [ ] Triage and respond to open issues
- [ ] Add at least one real-world use case (e.g. multi-agent scheduling)
- [ ] Add `examples/README.md` to explain what each agent example does
- [ ] Create `DISCUSSIONS` tab to collect feedback from early users

---

Once Priority 1 is complete, we can start inviting early feedback from select collaborators.
