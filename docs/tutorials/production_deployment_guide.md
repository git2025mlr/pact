# ðŸš€ Production Deployment Guide for PACT

Ready to move from prototype to production? This guide walks through best practices for deploying your PACT agent infrastructure in real-world environments.

## 1. Environment Preparation

- Use Docker or virtual environments to isolate agents
- Ensure your Python runtime matches project dependencies
- Store secrets securely (e.g., environment variables or Vault)

## 2. Secure HTTP Communication

- Use HTTPS endpoints (via reverse proxy like NGINX + Let's Encrypt)
- Implement basic authentication or OAuth2 if needed
- Rate-limit agent endpoints to avoid overload

## 3. Logging & Monitoring

- Enable request/response logging with timestamps and intent metadata
- Integrate with observability tools like Prometheus + Grafana
- Add alerts for fallback failure rates, unknown intents, or high latency

## 4. Scaling Strategy

- Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for async agent workflows
- Containerize agents and deploy via Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
- Horizontal scaling for stateless processors

## 5. Testing in Production

- Use canary agents for new features
- Shadow test new capabilities without affecting live traffic
- Log fallback decisions to audit behavior over time

## 6. Continuous Delivery

- Automate builds via CI pipelines (GitHub Actions, CircleCI)
- Run integration and fallback tests before deployment
- Version agent APIs and capability schemas clearly

By following these practices, you can deploy PACT systems that are **secure, observable, scalable, and resilient** in production environments.
